Big Nerd Ranch Guide beatbox app
This Big Nerd Ranch Guide project required importing assets - sound files - and playing sounds on demand using a SoundPool. It also required retaining fragments across rotation, as opposed to the usual destruction and recreation. Work on the GUI for this project taught the use and modification of Styles and Themes as well as using xml drawables and 9-patch images.
